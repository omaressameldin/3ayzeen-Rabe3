3ayzeen rabe3 is an app which helps when a group of people is playing a game and it's missing one or more players:
for example if you want to play tarneeb and you need a 4th player all you need to do is open the app check for possible players around you and then you can
 ping one of the possible players to play
feattures of the app will be:
register as an available group
only show available groups of the game you want to play
know the nearest players to your location
post on your timeline the scores of your game
share your posts on facebook or any other social media
message one of your firends
suggest new games for future releases
and much more (including the main required features i didnt mention)!
